I had uploaded 3 codes.A simple neural network,digit recognizer(kaggle datatset) using numpy and panda through creating hidden layers and a regression problem without sk learn(data found in a project(aca) i had done).
I had explained the concept of neural network in the pdf submitted,more of i had used andrew ng and few articles for understanding the topic and all the function.
I had mentioned the forward,backward propagation,gradient descent and use of acativation function in the pdf submitted,more of i will explain it further in the interview if selected
The basic idea remains same the maths we use for creating regression solution and hidden layer and it's backward and forward propagtion .
